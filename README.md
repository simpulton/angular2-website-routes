# Building an Angular 2 Website Using Routes
This is a simple Angular 2 website using the brand new router. It demonstrates how to build components, configure routes, inject services, and use the `@Input` decorator to bind properties to components.

## Dependencies
- You must have `node` and `npm` installed (via `brew install node` or [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org/en/));
- You must also have `typings` installed globally via `npm i -g typings`

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onehungrymind/fem-ng2-simple-app.git

```

Then navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080 and use the app.
